# gnome-ui

A modern, flexible UI component library for React, designed for rapid development and beautiful, accessible interfaces.

> **Note:** This library is extracted from NovaJAM and NovaJAM Pro, and will be reintegrated into those projects soon.

## Features

- **Composable blocks and elements** for building web pages quickly
- **Customizable themes** using CSS variables and Tailwind CSS
- **Storybook integration** for interactive component documentation
- **Ready-to-use components**: buttons, carousels, pricing plans, testimonials, and more
- **Accessibility-first**: semantic HTML and ARIA best practices

## Development

- Components are in `src/elements/`, `src/blocks/`, `src/compartments` and `src/sections`.
- Global styles and theme variables are in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- Storybook stories are in `src/elements/*/*.stories.ts`, `src/blocks/*/*.stories.ts`, `src/compartments/*/*.stories.ts` and `src/sections/*/*.stories.ts`.

### Run Storybook
